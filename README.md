In this project, we explore the subway of Taipei, Taiwan. We want to understand whether different demographics and land values will affect the ridership of the subway, and how the demand of subway responds to different temporal features. 

The Taipei subway network is quite dense and the data contains the number of trips between two stations which gave us the ability to be able to understand ridership demand. We use the volume of trips, demographic and land value data around each station to help us estimate demand at different groups based on day/night, weekend/weekday and season of the year.

This could help transit systems better prepare for spikes in ridership on public holidays and events at certain location.
